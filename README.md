# Loan-default-classification-model-using-TensorFlow
Built a supervised ML model to identify whether a loan will be repaid or not using customer financial and demographic data. Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering and applied techniques like normalisation, dropout to reduce overfitting. This model can help lenders make data-driven risk decisions and optimize credit strategies.
